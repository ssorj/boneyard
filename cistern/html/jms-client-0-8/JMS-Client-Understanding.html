<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Overview"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>The Qpid JMS client provides a JMS 1.1 compliant implementation. As such, the primary source of documentation is the <a href="&amp;oracleJmsSpec;">JMS specification</a> and the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;/javax/jms/package-summary.html">JMS javadocs</a>. This documentation assumes the reader has familiarity with these resources.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes how the Qpid JMS client behaves and the effect(s) making JMS method calls will have on the Broker.</p>
<p>There areas where the Qpid JMS client provides features beyond those required for JMS compliance. These are described in the sections that follow.</p>
<p>These sections are also used to bring out differences that may surprise those moving from JMS implementations provided by other vendors.</p>
<p><img src="images/QpidJmsOverview.png" alt="Architecture of a typical JMS application" /></p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-ConnectionFactory"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> ConnectionFactory</h1>
<p>A <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/ConnectionFactory.html">ConnectionFactory</a> allows an application to create a <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Connection.html">Connection</a>.</p>
<p>The application obtains the ConnectionFactory from an <a href="&amp;oracleJdkDocUrl;javax/naming/InitialContext.html">InitialContext</a>. The InitialContext is itself obtained from an InitialContextFactory.</p>
<p>The Qpid JMS client provides a single implementation of the InitialContextFactory in class <code>org.apache.qpid.jndi.PropertiesFileInitialContextFactory</code>. This implementation is backed by a <a href="&amp;oracleJdkDocUrl;java/util/Properties.html">Properties</a> object which can of course be loaded from an external properties file, or created programatically.</p>
<p>The examples in the previous chapter illustrated the Java code required to <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Examples-PTP">create the InitialContext</a> and an <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Examples-PTP-PropertiesFile">example properties file</a>.</p>
<p>The Qpid JMS client also provides an alternate connection factory implementation providing a connection pool. This can be useful when utilsing frameworks such as Spring. ?.</p>
<p><img src="images/JndiOverview.png" alt="JNDI overview" /></p>
<p>Note that the Qpid Broker does not present a JNDI interface to the application.</p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Connection</h1>
<p>A Connection represents an open communication channel between application and Broker.</p>
<p>Connections are created from the ConnectionFactory <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Each connection utilises a single TCP/IP connection between the process of the application and the process of the Broker. The act of establishing a connection is therefore a relatively expensive operation. It is recommended that the same connection is used for a series of message interactions. Patterns utilising a connection per message should not be used.</p>
<p>The underlying TCP/IP connection remains open for the lifetime of the JMS connection. It is closed when the application calls <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Connection.html#close()">Connection#close()</a>, but it can also be closed if the connection is closed from the Broker side (via a Management operation or broker shutdown or running into conditions which AMQP specifications treats as errors and mandates closing the connection). The JMS connection will also be closed if the underlying TCP/IP connection is broken.</p>
<p>Qpid connections have failover and heartbeating capabilities. They support SSL and client-auth. These are described in the sub-sections that follow.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection-Failover"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Failover</h2>
<p>Qpid connections support a failover feature. This is the ability to automatically re-establish a failed connection, either to the same Broker, or the next Broker in the broker list.</p>
<p>This failover process is done in a manner that is mostly transparent to the application. After a successful failover, any existing Connection, Session, MessageConsumer and MessageProducer objects held by the application remain valid.</p>
<p>If a failover occurs during the scope of a JMS Transaction, any work performed by that transaction is lost. The application is made aware of this loss by way of the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/TransactionRolledBackException.html">TransactionRolledBackException</a> from the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#commit">Session#commit()</a> call. Applications utilising failover must be prepared to catch this exception and respond by either repeating the work of the transaction, or by propagating a rollback to the originating system.</p>
<p>If, after all retries are exhausted, failover has failed to reconnect the application, the Connection's <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/ExceptionListener.html">ExceptionListener</a> will receive a JMSException with a linked exception of <a href="JMS-Client-0-8-Appendix-Exceptions-AMQDisconnectedException">AMQDisconnectedException</a>. Any further use of the JMS objects (Connection, Session etc), will results in a <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/IllegalStateException.html">IllegalStateException</a>.</p>
<p>Configure failover using the Connection URL. Here's an example Connection URL utilising failover between two brokers. Note the use of the broker options <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-Retries"><code>retries</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-ConnectDelay"><code>connectdelay</code></a> to control the number of connection attempts to each individual broker, and the delay between each connection attempt. Also note the use of the <em>failover option</em> <code>cyclecount</code> to control the number of times the failover mechanism will traverse the brokerlist.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://username:password@clientid/test
            ?brokerlist=&#39;tcp://localhost:15672?retries=&#39;10&#39;&amp;connectdelay=&#39;1000&#39;;tcp://localhost:25672?retries=&#39;10&#39;&amp;connectdelay=&#39;1000&#39;&#39;
            &amp;failover=&#39;roundrobin?cyclecount=&#39;20&#39;&#39;
        </code></pre>
<p>For full details see ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Note, that a single broker failover is enabled by default. If the failover behaviour is not desired it can be switched off by setting a failover option to <code>nofailover</code> as in the example below</p>
<pre><code>amqp://username:password@clientid/test
            ?brokerlist=&#39;tcp://localhost:15672?failover=&#39;nofailover&#39;
        </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection-Heartbeating"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Heartbeating</h2>
<p>Qpid connections support heartbeating. When enabled, the Qpid JMS client and Broker exchange a heartbeat during periods of inactivity. This allows both peers to discover if the TCP/IP connection becomes inoperable in a timely manner.</p>
<p>This feature is sometimes useful in applications that must traverse firewalls as the heartbeat prevents connections from being closed during periods when there is no application traffic.</p>
<p>It is also allows the both the JMS client and the Broker to confirm that the other is <em>minimally</em> responsive. (It does nothing however to determine the health of the higher level tiers of application, for this reason, applications may implement an application level heartbeat either in addition to, or instead of the heartbeat.</p>
<p>If the client ever fails to receive two consecutive heartbeats, the Connection will be automatically closed and the Connection's <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/ExceptionListener.html">ExceptionListener</a> will receive a JMSException with a linked exception of AMQDisconnectedException. Any further use of the JMS objects (Connection, Session etc), will results in a <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/IllegalStateException.html">IllegalStateException</a>.</p>
<p>To enable heartbeating either use a Connection URL including the broker option <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-Heartbeat"><code>heartbeat</code></a>, or use the system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-Heartbeat"><code>qpid.heartbeat</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://guest:guest@clientid/?brokerlist=&#39;localhost:5672?heartbeat=&#39;5&#39;&#39;
        </code></pre>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection-SSL"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> SSL</h2>
<p>The Qpid JMS client supports connections encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and SSL-Client Authentication. SSL is configured using Connection URL. To use SSL, SSL must be be configured on the Broker.</p>
<p>Some example Connection URLs using SSL follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simple SSL when the Broker is secured by a certificate that is signed by a CA which is trusted by the JVM.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://guest:guest@clientid/?brokerlist=&#39;localhost:5671&#39;&amp;ssl=&#39;true&#39;
            </code></pre></li>
<li><p>SSL when the Broker is secured by a certificate that is signed by a CA which is NOT trusted by the JVM (such as when a organisation is using a private CA, or self-signed certificates are in use). For this case, we use <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-TrustStore"><code>trust_store</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-TrustStorePassword"><code>trust_store_password</code></a> to specify a path a truststore file (containing the certificate of the private-CA) and the truststore password.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://guest:guest@clientid/?brokerlist=&#39;localhost:5671?trust_store=&#39;/path/to/acme_org_ca.ts&#39;&amp;trust_store_password=&#39;secret&#39;&#39;&amp;ssl=&#39;true&#39;
            </code></pre></li>
<li><p>SSL with SSL client-auth. For this case, we use <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-KeyStore"><code>key_store</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-KeyStorePassword"><code>key_store_password</code></a> to specify a path a keystore file (containing the certificate of the client) and the keystore password.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://guest:guest@clientid/?brokerlist=&#39;localhost:5671?key_store=&#39;/path/to/app1_client_cert.ks&#39;&amp;key_store_password=&#39;secret&#39;&#39;&amp;ssl=&#39;true&#39;
            </code></pre>
<p>Alternatively we can use <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-ClientCertPath"><code>client_cert_path</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-ClientCertPrivKeyPath"><code>client_cert_priv_key_ath</code></a> to specify a path to a certificate file (in PEM or DER format) and the private key information (again in either PEM or DER format) respectively.</p>
<pre><code>amqp://guest:guest@clientid/?brokerlist=&#39;localhost:5671?client_cert_path=&#39;/path/to/app1_client.crt&#39;&amp;client_cert_priv_key_path=&#39;/path/to/app1_client.key&#39;&#39;&amp;ssl=&#39;true&#39;
            </code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Connection-MessageCompression"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Message Compression</h2>
<p>The client has the ability to transparently compress message payloads on outgoing messages and decompress them on incoming messages. In some environments and with some payloads this feature might offer performance improvements by reducing the number of bytes transmitted over the connection.</p>
<p>In order to make use of message compression, the Broker must enable the feature too, otherwise the compression options will be ignored.</p>
<p>To enable message compression on the client use the connection url property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-CompressMessages"><code>compressMessages</code></a> (or JVM wide using the system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-ConnectionCompressMessages"><code>qpid.connection_compress_messages</code></a>)</p>
<p>It is also possible to control the threshold at which the client will begin to compress message payloads. See connection url property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-MessageCompressionThresholdSize"><code>messageCompressionThresholdSize</code></a> (or JVM wide using the system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-MessageCompressionThresholdSize"><code>qpid.message_compression_threshold_size</code></a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The Broker, where necessary, takes care of compressing/decompressing messages of the fly so that clients using message compression can exchange messages with clients not supporting message compression transparently, without application intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Session"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Session</h1>
<p>A Session object is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming messages.</p>
<p>Session objects are created from the Connection. Whilst Session objects are relatively lightweight, patterns utilising a single Session per message are not recommended.</p>
<p>The number of sessions open per connection at any one time is limited. This value is negotiated when the connection is made. It defaults to 256.</p>
<p>Qpid JMS Sessions have the ability to prefetch messages to improve consumer performance. This feature is described next.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Session-Prefecth"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Prefetch</h2>
<p>Prefetch specifies how many messages the client will optimistically cache for delivery to a consumer. This is a useful parameter to tune that can improve the throughput of an application. The prefetch buffer is scoped per <em>Session</em>.</p>
<p>The size of the prefetch buffer can be tuned per Connection using the connection url option <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Maxprefetch"><code>maxprefetch</code></a> (or JVM wide using the system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-Maxprefetch"><code>max_prefetch</code></a>). By default, prefetch defaults to 500.</p>
<p>There are situations when you may wish to consider reducing the size of prefetch:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When using a <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html">Competing Consumers</a> pattern, prefetch can give the appearance of unequal division of work. This will be apparent on startup when the queue has messages. The first consumer started will cache prefetch size number of messages, possibly leaving the other consumers with no initial work.</p></li>
<li><p>When using special queue types (such as LVQs, Sorted Queue and Priority Queues). For these queue types the special delivery rules apply whilst the message resides on the Broker. As soon as the message is sent to the client it delivery order is then fixed. For example, if using a priority queue, and a prefetch of 100, and 100 messages arrive with priority 2, the broker will send these to the client. If then a new message arrives with priority 1, the broker cannot leap frog messages of the lower priority. The priority 1 message will be delivered at the front of the next batch.</p></li>
<li><p>When message size is large and you do not wish the memory footprint of the application to grow (or suffer an OutOfMemoryError).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if using multiple MessageConsumers on a single Session, keep in mind that unless you keep polling <em>all</em> consumers, it is possible for some traffic patterns to result in consumer starvation and an application level deadlock. For example, if prefetch is 100, and 100 hundred messages arrive suitable for consumer A, those messages will be prefetched by the session, entirely filling the prefetch buffer. Now if the application performs a blocking <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/MessageConsumer.html#receive()">MessageConsumer#receive()</a> for Consumer B on the same Session, the application will hang indefinitely as even if messages suitable for B arrive at the Broker. Those messages can never be sent to the Session as no space is available in prefetch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Please note, when the acknowledgement mode <em>Session#SESSION_TRANSACTED</em> or <em>Session#CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</em> is set on a consuming session, the prefetched messages are released from the prefetch buffer on transaction commit/rollback (in case of acknowledgement mode <em>Session#SESSION_TRANSACTED</em> ) or acknowledgement of the messages receipt (in case of acknowledgement mode <em>Session#CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</em> ). If the consuming application does not commit/rollback the receiving transaction (for example, due to mistakes in application exception handling logic), the prefetched messages continue to remain in the prefetch buffer preventing the delivery of the following messages. As result, the application might stop the receiving of the messages until the transaction is committed/rolled back (for <em>Session#SESSION_TRANSACTED</em> ) or received messages are acknowledged (for <em>Session#CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Settings maxprefetch to 0 ( either globally via JVM system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-Maxprefetch"><code>max_prefetch</code></a> or on a connection level as a connection option <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-Maxprefetch"><code>maxprefetch</code></a> ) switches off the pre-fetching functionality. With maxprefetch=0 messages are fetched one by one without caching on the client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Setting maxprefetch to 0 is recommended in Spring-JMS based applications whenever <em>DefaultMassgeListenerContainer</em> is configured with a <em>CachingConnectionFactory</em> that has <em>cacheLevel</em> set to either <em>CACHE_CONSUMER</em> or <em>CACHE_SESSION</em>. In these configurations the Qpid JMS <em>Session</em> objects remain open in Spring's dynamically scaled pools. If maxprefetch is not 0, any prefetched messages held by the <em>Session</em> and any new ones subsequently sent to it (in the background until prefetch is reached) will be effectively by 'stuck' (unavailable to the application) until Spring decides to utilise the cached Session again. This can give the impression that message delivery has stopped even though messages remain of the queue. Setting maxprefetch to 0 prevents this problem from occurring.</p>
<p>If using maxprefetch &gt; 0 <em>SingleConnectionFactory</em> must be used. SingleConnectionFactory does not have the same session/consumer caching behaviour so does not exhibit the same problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Session-TemporaryQueues"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> TemporaryQueues</h2>
<p>Qpid implements JMS temporary queues as AMQP auto-delete queues. The life cycle of these queues deviates from the JMS specification.</p>
<p>AMQP auto-delete queues are deleted either when the <em>last</em> Consumer closes, or the Connection is closed. If no Consumer is ever attached to the queue, the queue will remain until the Connection is closed.</p>
<p>This deviation has no practical impact on the implementation of the <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/RequestReply.html">request/reply messaging pattern</a> utilising a per-request temporary reply queue. The reply to queue is deleted as the application closes the Consumer awaiting the response.</p>
<p>Temporary queues are exposed to Management in the same way as normal queues. Temporary queue names take the form string <code>TempQueue</code> followed by a random UUID.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/TemporaryQueue.html#delete()">TemporaryQueue#delete()</a> merely marks the queue as deleted on within the JMS client (and prevents further use of the queue from the application), however, the Queue will remain on the Broker until the Consumer (or Connection) is closed.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Session-CreateQueue"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> CreateQueue</h2>
<p>In the Qpid JMS client, <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#createQueue(java.lang.String)">Session#createQueue()</a> accepts either a queue name, or a Binding URL. If only name is specified the destination will be resolved into binding URL: direct://amq.direct//&lt;queue name&gt;?routingkey='&lt;queue name&gt;'&amp;durable='true'.</p>
<p>Calling Session#createQueue() has no effect on the Broker.</p>
<p>Reiterating the advice from the JMS javadoc, it is suggested that this method is not generally used. Instead, application should lookup Destinations declared within JNDI.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Session-CreateTopic"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> CreateTopic</h2>
<p>In the Qpid JMS client, <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#createTopic(java.lang.String)">Session#createTopic()</a> accepts either a topic name, or a Binding URL. If only name is specified the destination will be resolved into binding URL: topic://amq.topic//&lt;topic name&gt;?routingkey='&lt;topic name&gt;'.</p>
<p>Calling Session#createTopic() has no effect on the Broker.</p>
<p>Reiterating the advice from the JMS javadoc, it is suggested that this method is not generally used. Instead, application should lookup Destinations declared within JNDI.</p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageProducer"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> MessageProducer</h1>
<p>A MessageProducer sends a message an <em>Exchange</em>. It is the Exchange (within the Broker) that routes the message to zero or more queue(s). Routing is performed according to rules expressed as <em>bindings</em> between the exchange and queues and a <em>routing key</em> included with each message.</p>
<p>To understand how this mechanism is used to deliver messages to queues and topics, see <a href="&amp;qpidJavaBrokerBook;Java-Broker-Concepts-Exchanges.html">Exchanges</a> within the Java Broker book.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that when synchronous publish is not exlicitly enabled, <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/MessageProducer.html#send(javax.jms.Message)">MessageProducer#send()</a> is <em>asynchronous</em> in nature. When #send() returns to the application, the application cannot be certain if the Broker has received the message. The Qpid JMS client may not have yet started to send the message, the message could residing in a TCP/IP buffer, or the messages could be in some intermediate buffer within the Broker. If the application requires certainty the message has been received by the Broker, a <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#SESSION_TRANSACTED">transactional session</a> <em>must</em> be used, or synchronous publishing must be enabled using either the <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-SyncPublish">system property</a> or the <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-SyncPublish">connection URL option</a>.</p>
<p>Qpid JMS MessageProducers have a number of features above that required by JMS. These are described in the sub-sections that follow.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageProducer-MandatoryMessage"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Mandatory Messages</h2>
<p>With this feature, publishing a message with a routing key for which no binding exists on the exchange will result in the message being returned to the publisher's connection.</p>
<p>The Message is returned to the application in an asynchronous fashion via the Connection's <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/ExceptionListener.html">ExceptionListener</a>. When a message is returned, it will be invoked with a JMSException whose linked exception is an <a href="JMS-Client-0-8-Appendix-Exceptions-AMQNoRouteException">AMQNoRouteException</a>. The returned message is available to the application by calling AMQNoRouteException#getUndeliveredMessage(). The ExceptionListener will be invoked exactly once for each returned message.</p>
<p>If synchronous publishing has been enabled, and a mandatory message is returned, the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/MessageProducer.html#send(javax.jms.Message)">MessageProducer#send()</a> method will throw a JMSException.</p>
<p>The mandatory message feature is turned <em>on</em> by default for Queue destinations and <em>off</em> for Topic destinations. This can be overridden using system properties <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-DefaultMandatory"><code>qpid.default_mandatory</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-DefaultMandatoryTopic"><code>qpid.default_mandatory_topic</code></a> for Queues and Topics respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If this the mandatory flag is not set, the Broker will treat <a href="&amp;qpidJavaBrokerBook;Java-Broker-Concepts-Exchanges.html#Java-Broker-Concepts-Exchanges-UnroutableMessage">the messages as unroutable</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageProducer-CloseWhenNoRoute"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Close When No Route</h2>
<p>With this feature, if a mandatory message is published with a routing key for which no binding exists on the exchange the Broker will close the connection. This client feature requires support for the corresponding feature by the Broker.</p>
<p>To enable or disable from the client, use the Connection URL option <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-ConnectionOptions-CloseWhenNoRoute"><code>closeWhenNoRoute</code></a>.</p>
<p>See <a href="&amp;qpidJavaBrokerBook;Java-Broker-Close-Connection-When-No-Route.html">Closing client connections on unroutable mandatory messages</a> within the Java Broker book for full details of the functioning of this feature.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageProducer-ImmediateMessage"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Immediate Messages</h2>
<p>This feature is defined in <a href="&amp;amqpSrc;">AMQP specifications</a>.</p>
<p>When this feature is enabled, when publishing a message the Broker ensures that a Consumer is attached to queue. If there is no Consumer attached to the queue, the message is returned to the publisher's connection. The Message is returned to the application in an asynchronous fashion using the Connection's <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/ExceptionListener.html">ExceptionListener</a>.</p>
<p>The ExceptionListener will be invoked with a JMSException whose linked exception is an <a href="JMS-Client-0-8-Appendix-Exceptions-AMQNoConsumersException">AMQNoConsumersException</a>. The returned message is available to the application by calling AMQNoConsumersException#getUndeliveredMessage(). The ExceptionListener will be invoked exactly once for each returned message.</p>
<p>If synchronous publishing has been enabled, and an immediate message is returned, the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/MessageProducer.html#send(javax.jms.Message)">MessageProducer#send()</a> method will throw a JMSException.</p>
<p>The immediate message feature is turned <em>off</em> by default. It can be enabled with system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-DefaultImmediate"><code>qpid.default_immediate</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageProducer-FlowControl"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Flow Control</h2>
<p>With this feature, if a message is sent to a queue that is overflow, the producer's session is blocked until the queue becomes underfull, or a timeout expires. This client feature requires support for the corresponding feature by the Broker.</p>
<p>To control the timeout use System property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-FlowControlWaitFailure"><code>qpid.flow_control_wait_failure</code></a>. To control the frequency with which warnings are logged whilst a Session is blocked, use System property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-FlowControlWaitNotifyPeriod"><code>qpid.flow_control_wait_notify_period</code></a></p>
<p>See <a href="&amp;qpidJavaBrokerBook;Java-Broker-Runtime-Disk-Space-Management.html#Qpid-Producer-Flow-Control">Producer Flow Control</a> within the Java Broker book for full details of the functioning of this feature.</p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageConsumer"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> MessageConsumer</h1>
<p>A MessageConsumer receives messages from a Queue or Topic.</p>
<p>MessageConsumer objects are created from the Session.</p>
<p>Qpid JMS MessageConsumers have a number of features above that required by JMS. These are described in the sub-sections that follow.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageConsumer-ConsumerSideEffect"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Consumers have Exchange/Queue Declaration and Binding Side Effect</h2>
<p>By default, calling <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#createConsumer(javax.jms.Destination)">Session#createConsumer()</a> will cause:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If the exchange does not exist on the Broker, it will be created. The exchange is specified by the Binding URL associated with the Destination.</p></li>
<li><p>If the queue does not exist on the Broker, it will be created. The queue is specified by the Binding URL associated with the Destination.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no binding between the exchange and queue, a binding will be created using the routingkey as a bindingkey. The exchange, queue and routing key are specified by the Binding URL associated with the Destination.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The exchange declare, queue declare and bind side effects can be suppressed using system properties <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-DeclareExchanges"><code>qpid.declare_exchanges</code></a>, <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-DeclareQueues"><code>qpid.declare_queues</code></a> and <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-BindQueues"><code>qpid.bind_queues</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageConsumer-TopicSubscriptions"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Topic Subscriptions</h2>
<p>The Qpid JMS client implements each subscription to a Topic as separate queue on the Broker. From the perspective of the JMS application this implementational detail is irrelevant: the application never needs to directly address these queues. However, these details are important when considering Management and Operational concerns.</p>
<p>Durable topic subscriptions use a <em>durable</em> and <em>exclusive</em> queue named as follows:</p>
<pre><code>        clientid: + subscriptionId
      </code></pre>
<p>where <code>subscriptionId</code> is that passed to the <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#createDurableSubscriber(javax.jms.Topic,%20java.lang.String)">Session#createDurableSubscriber(javax.jms.Topic,java.lang.String)</a></p>
<p>Calling <a href="&amp;oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/Session.html#unsubscribe(java.lang.String)">Session#unsubscribe(java.lang.String)</a> deletes the underlying queue.</p>
<p>Non-durable topic subscriptions use a <em>non-durable</em>, <em>exclusive</em> and <em>auto-delete</em> queue named as follows:</p>
<pre><code>        tmp + _ + ip + _ + port + _ + sequence
      </code></pre>
<p>where <code>ip</code> is the ip address of the client with dots replaced by underscores, <code>port</code> is the ephemeral port number assigned to the client's connection, and <code>sequence</code> is a sequence number.</p>
<p>Closing the consumer (or closing the connection) will delete the underlying queue.</p>
<h2 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-MessageConsumer-MaximumDeliveryCount"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Maximum Delivery Count</h2>
<p>With this feature, the Broker keeps track of a number of times a message has been delivered to a consumer. If the count ever exceeds a threshold value, the Broker moves the message to a dead letter queue (DLQ). This is used to prevent poison messages preventing a system's operation. This client feature requires support for the corresponding feature by the Broker.</p>
<p>When using this feature, the application must either set system property <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-System-Properties-RejectBehaviour">qpid.reject.behaviour</a> or the Binding URL option <a href="#JMS-Client-0-8-Binding-URL-Options-RejectBehaviour"><code>rejectbehaviour</code></a> to the value <code>server</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="&amp;qpidJavaBrokerBook;Java-Broker-Runtime-Handling-Undeliverable-Messages.html#Java-Broker-Runtime-Handling-Undeliverable-Messages-Maximum-Delivery-Count">Handling Undeliverable Messages</a> within the Java Broker book for full details of the functioning of this feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The optional JMS message header <code>JMSXDeliveryCount</code> is <em>not</em> supported.</p>

<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Client-Understanding-Destinations"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Destinations</h1>
<p>A Destination is either a Queue or Topic. In the Qpid JMS client a Destination encapsulates a Binding URL. In simple terms, the Binding URL comprises of an exchange, queue and a routing key. Binding URLs are described fully by ?.</p>
<p>In many cases, applications do not need to deal directly with Binding URLs, instead they can refer to JMS administered objects declared in the JNDI properties file with the <code>queue.</code> and <code>topic.</code> prefix to create Queues and Topics objects respectively.</p>
