<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Logging</h1>
<p>The Qpid JMS client uses the <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">Apache SLF4J</a> logging framework. All logging activity created by the client is directed through the SLF4J API. SLF4J is a is a fa√ßade for other common logging frameworks. This makes it easy for application authors to use their prefered logging framework in their application stack, and have the Qpid JMS Client use it too.</p>
<p>SLF4J suppplies bindings for many common logging frameworks (<a href="&amp;oracleJdkDocUrl;java/util/logging/package-summary.html">JUL</a>, <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">Apache Log4J</a>, <a href="http://logback.qos.ch">Logback</a>.</p>
<p>Include the SLF4J binding corresponding to the logging framework of your choosen logging framework on classpath. For full details, see the SLF4J <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">documentation</a>.</p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging-RecommendedProductionLoggingLevel"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Recommended Production Logging Level</h1>
<p>In production, it is recommended that you configure your logging framework is configured with logger <code>org.apache.qpid</code> set to <code>WARN</code>.</p>
<p>If you are using Apache Log4j with a log4j.properties file, this simply means adding the following line:</p>
<pre><code>      org.apache.qpid=WARN
    </code></pre>
<p>If you are using another logging framework, or you are using Log4j but configuring in another manner, refer to the documentation accompanying the logging framework for details of how to proceed.</p>
<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging-EnablingDebugLogging"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Enabling Debug</h1>
<p>If you are experiencing a problem, it can be informative to enable debug logging to allow the behaviour of the Qpid JMS client to be understood at a deeper level.</p>
<p>To do this, set the <code>org.apache.qpid</code> logger to <code>DEBUG</code>.</p>
<p>If you are using Apache Log4j with a log4j.properties file, this simply means adding (or changing) the following line:</p>
<pre><code>      org.apache.qpid=DEBUG
    </code></pre>
<p>If you are using another logging framework, or you are using Log4j but configuring in another manner, refer to the documentation accompanying the logging framework for details of how to proceed.</p>
