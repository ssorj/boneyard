<h1 id="JMS-Client-0-8-Introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Qpid JMS client is an implementation of <a href="&amp;oracleJmsSpec;">JMS specification 1.1</a>. It utilises an <a href="&amp;amqpSrc;">AMQP</a> transport layer for the performing of messaging operations. The client is intended to be used for the writing of JMS compatible messaging applications. Such applications can send and receive messages via any AMQP-compatible brokers like RabbitMQ, Qpid Java Broker which support the AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, or 0-9-1.</p>
<p>The Qpid JMS client hides the details of AMQP transport implementation behind the JMS API. Thus, the developers need only to be familiar with JMS API in order to use the client. However, the knowledge of the basic concepts of AMQP protocols can help developers in writing reliable and high-performant messaging application.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>This book documents the behaviour of the Qpid JMS client when used with the AMQP protocols <em>0-8, 0-9, and 0-9-1</em> only. For behaviour when using the client with AMQP 0-10 protocol, please refer to <a href="&amp;qpidProgrammingBook;">Programming in Apache Qpid</a>.</p>
