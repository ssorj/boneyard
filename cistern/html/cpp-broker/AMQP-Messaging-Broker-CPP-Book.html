<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Qpid provides two AMQP messaging brokers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented in C++ - high performance, low latency, and RDMA support.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented in Java - Fully JMS compliant, runs on any Java platform.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both AMQP messaging brokers support clients in multiple languages, as long as the messaging client and the messaging broker use the same version of AMQP. See <a href="#AMQP-Compatibility">AMQP Compatibility</a> to see which messaging clients work with each broker.</p>
<p>This manual contains information specific to the broker that is implemented in C++.</p>
