<h1 id="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Entities"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Managing Entities</h1>
<p>This section describes how to manage entities within the Broker. The principles underlying entity management are the same regardless of entity type. For this reason, this section begins with a general description that applies to all.</p>
<p>Since not all channels support the management of all entity type, this section commences with a table showing which entity type is supported by each channel.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Entities-General"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> General Description</h1>
<p>The following description applies to all entities within the Broker regardless of their type.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All entities have a parent, and may have children. The parent of the Broker is called the System Context. It has no parent.</p></li>
<li><p>Entities have one or more attributes. For example a <code>name</code>, an <code>id</code> or a <code>maximumQueueDepth</code></p></li>
<li><p>Entities can be durable or non-durable. Durable entities survive a restart. Non-durable entities will not.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributes may have a default value. If an attribute value is not specified the default value is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributes values can be expressed as a simple value (e.g. <code>myName</code> or <code>1234</code>), in terms of context variables (e.g.<code>${foo}</code> or <code>/data/${foo}/</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Each entity has zero or more context variables.</p></li>
<li><p>The System Context entity (the ultimate ancestor of all object) has a context too. It is read only and is populated with all Java System Properties. Thus it can be influenced from the Broker's external environment. See <a href="#Java-Broker-Appendix-Environment-Variables-Qpid-Opts">QPID_OPTS</a> environment variable.</p></li>
<li><p>When resolving an attribute's value, if the value contains a variable (e.g.<code>${foo}</code>), the variable is first resolved using the entity's own context variables. If the entity has no definition for the context variable, the entity's parent is tried, then its grandparent and so forth, all the way until the SystemContext is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Some entities support state and have a lifecycle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What follows now is a section dedicated to each entity type. For each entity type key features are described along with the entities key attributes, key context variables, details of the entities lifecycle and any other operations.</p>
