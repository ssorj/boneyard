<h1 id="Java-Broker-Management-Channel"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Management Channels</h1>
<p>The Broker can be managed over a number of different channels.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP - The primary channel for management. The HTTP interface comprises of a Web Console and a REST API.</p></li>
<li><p>JMX - The Broker provides a JMX compliant management interface. This is not currently undergoing further development and is retained largely for backward compatibility. It is suggested the new users favour the Web Console/REST API.</p></li>
<li><p>AMQP - The AMQP protocols 0-8..0-10 allow for some management of Exchanges, Queue and Bindings. This will be superseded by AMQP 1.0 Management. It is suggested that new users favour the Management facilities provided by the Web Console/REST API.</p></li>
</ul>
