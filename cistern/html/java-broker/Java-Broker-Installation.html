<h1 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This document describes how to install the Java Broker on both Windows and UNIX platforms.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Prerequisites</h1>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Java"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Java Platform</h2>
<p>The Java Broker is an 100% Java implementation and as such it can be used on any operating system supporting Java 1.7 or higher<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This includes Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista/7/8.</p>
<p>The broker has been tested with Java implementations from both Oracle and IBM. Whatever platform you chose, it is recommended that you ensure it is patched with any critical updates made available from the vendor.</p>
<p>Verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <a href="#Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification">these instructions.</a></p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Disk"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Disk</h2>
<p>The Java Broker installation requires approximately 20MB of free disk space.</p>
<p>The Java Broker also requires a working directory. The working directory is used for the message store, that is, the area of the file-system used to record persistent messages whilst they are passing through the Broker. The working directory is also used for the default location of the log file. The size of the working directory will depend on the how the Broker is used.</p>
<p>The performance of the file system hosting the work directory is key to the performance of Broker as a whole. For best performance, choose a device that has low latency and one that is uncontended by other applications.</p>
<p>Be aware that there are additional considerations if you are considering hosting the working directory on NFS.</p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Memory"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Memory</h2>
<p>Qpid caches messages on the heap for performance reasons, so in general, the Broker will benefit from as much heap as possible. However, on a 32bit JVM, the maximum addressable memory range for a process is 4GB, after leaving space for the JVM's own use this will give a maximum heap size of approximately ~3.7GB.</p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-OperatingSystemAccount"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Operating System Account</h2>
<p>Installation or operation of Qpid does <em>not</em> require a privileged account (i.e. root on UNIX platforms or Administrator on Windows). However it is suggested that you use an dedicated account (e.g. qpid) for the installation and operation of the Java Broker.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Download"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Download</h1>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-Download-Release"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Broker Release</h2>
<p>You can download the latest Java broker package from the <a href="&amp;qpidDownloadUrl;">Download Page</a>.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you confirm the integrity of the download by verifying the PGP signature matches that available on the site. Instructions are given on the download page.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Installation-InstallationWindows"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Installation on Windows</h1>
<p>Firstly, verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <a href="#Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification-Windows">these instructions.</a></p>
<p>Now chose a directory for Qpid broker installation. This directory will be used for the Qpid JARs and configuration files. It need not be the same location as the work directory used for the persistent message store or the log file (you will choose this location later). For the remainder this example we will assume that location c:\qpid has been chosen.</p>
<p>Next extract the WINDOWSBROKERDOWNLOADFILENAME package into the directory, using either the zip file handling offered by Windows (right click the file and select 'Extract All') or a third party tool of your choice.</p>
<p>The extraction of the broker package will have created a directory WINDOWSEXTRACTEDBROKERDIRNAME within c:\qpid</p>

<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-InstallationWindows-SettingQPIDWORK"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Setting the working directory</h2>
<p>Qpid requires a work directory. This directory is used for the default location of the Qpid log file and is used for the storage of persistent messages. The work directory can be set on the command-line (for the lifetime of the command interpreter), but you will normally want to set the environment variable permanently via the Advanced System Settings in the Control Panel.</p>
<pre><code>set QPID_WORK=C:\qpidwork</code></pre>
<p>If the directory referred to by <a href="#Java-Broker-Appendix-Environment-Variables-Qpid-Work">QPID_WORK</a> does not exist, the Java Broker will attempt to create it on start-up.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Installation-InstallationUnix"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Installation on UNIX platforms</h1>
<p>Firstly, verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <a href="#Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification-Unix">these instructions.</a></p>
<p>Now chose a directory for Qpid broker installation. This directory will be used for the Qpid JARs and configuration files. It need not be the same location as the work directory used for the persistent message store or the log file (you will choose this location later). For the remainder this example we will assume that location /usr/local/qpid has been chosen.</p>
<p>Next extract the UNIXBROKERDOWNLOADFILENAME package into the directory.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/qpid
cd /usr/local/qpid
tar xvzf UNIXBROKERDOWNLOADFILENAME</code></pre>
<p>The extraction of the broker package will have created a directory UNIXEXTRACTEDBROKERDIRNAME within /usr/local/qpid</p>

<h2 id="Java-Broker-Installation-InstallationUnix-SettingQPIDWORK"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Setting the working directory</h2>
<p>Qpid requires a work directory. This directory is used for the default location of the Qpid log file and is used for the storage of persistent messages. The work directory can be set on the command-line (for the lifetime of the current shell), but you will normally want to set the environment variable permanently the user's shell profile file (~/.bash_profile for Bash etc).</p>
