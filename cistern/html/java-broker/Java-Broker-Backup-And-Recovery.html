<h1 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Broker"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Broker</h1>
<p>To perform a complete backup whilst the Broker is shutdown, simply copy all the files the exist beneath <code>${QPID_WORK}</code>, assuming all virtualhost nodes and virtualhost are in their standard location, this will copy all configuration and persistent message data.</p>
<p>There is currently no safe mechanism to take a complete copy of the entire Broker whilst it is running.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Virtualhost-Node"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Virtualhost Node</h1>
<p>To perform a complete backup of a Virtualhost node whilst it is stopped (or Broker down), simply copy all the files the exist beneath <code>${QPID_WORK}/&lt;nodename&gt;/config</code>, assuming the virtualhost node is in the standard location. This will copy all configuration that belongs to that virtualhost node.</p>
<p>The technique for backing up a virtualhost node whilst it is running depends on its type.</p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Virtualhost-Node-BDB"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> BDB</h2>
<p>Qpid Broker distribution includes the &quot;hot&quot; backup utility <code>backup.sh</code> which can be found at broker bin folder. This utility can perform the backup when broker is running.</p>
<p><code>backup.sh</code> script invokes <code>org.apache.qpid.server.store.berkeleydb.BDBBackup</code> to do the job.</p>
<p>You can also run this class from command line like in an example below:</p>
java
-cp qpid-bdbstore-QPIDCURRENTRELEASE.jar
org.apache.qpid.server.store.berkeleydb.BDBBackup
-fromdir
${QPID_WORK}/&lt;nodename&gt;/config
-todir
path/to/backup/folder
<p>In the example above BDBBackup utility is called from qpid-bdbstore-QPIDCURRENTRELEASE.jar to backup the store at <code>${QPID_WORK}/&lt;nodename&gt;/config</code> and copy store logs into <code>path/to/backup/folder</code>.</p>
<p>Linux and Unix users can take advantage of <code>backup.sh</code> bash script by running this script in a similar way.</p>
backup.sh
-fromdir
${QPID_WORK}/&lt;nodename&gt;/config
-todir
path/to/backup/folder

<p>The responsibility for backup is delegated to the database server itself. See the documentation accompanying it. Any technique that takes a consistent snapshot of the database is acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Virtualhost-Node-JSON"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> JSON</h2>
<p>JSON stores its config in a single text file. It can be safely backed up using standard command line tools.</p>
<h1 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Virtualhost"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Virtualhost</h1>
<p>To perform a complete backup of a Virtualhost whilst it is stopped (or Broker down), simply copy all the files the exist beneath <code>${QPID_WORK}/&lt;name&gt;/messages</code>, assuming the virtualhost is in the standard location. This will copy all messages that belongs to that virtualhost.</p>
<p>The technique for backing up a virtualhost whilst it is running depends on its type.</p>
<h2 id="Java-Broker-Backup-And-Recovery-Virtualhost-BDB"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> BDB</h2>
<p>Use the same backup utility described above, but use the path <code>${QPID_WORK}/&lt;name&gt;/messages</code> instead.</p>
