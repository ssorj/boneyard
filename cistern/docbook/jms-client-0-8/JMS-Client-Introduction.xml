<chapter id="JMS-Client-0-8-Introduction">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>Qpid JMS client is an implementation of <ulink url="&oracleJmsSpec;">JMS specification
      1.1</ulink>. It utilises an <ulink url="&amqpSrc;">AMQP</ulink> transport layer for the performing of messaging operations.
    The client is intended to be used for the writing of JMS compatible messaging applications. Such
    applications can send and receive messages via any AMQP-compatible brokers like RabbitMQ, Qpid
    Java Broker which support the AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, or 0-9-1.</para>
  <para>The Qpid JMS client hides the details of AMQP transport implementation behind the JMS API.
    Thus, the developers need only to be familiar with JMS API in order to use the client. However,
    the knowledge of the basic concepts of AMQP protocols can help developers in writing reliable
    and high-performant messaging application. </para>

    <title>Using the Qpid JMS client with 0-10</title>
    <para>This book documents the behaviour of the Qpid JMS client when used with the AMQP
      protocols <emphasis>0-8, 0-9, and 0-9-1</emphasis> only. For behaviour when using the client
      with AMQP 0-10 protocol, please refer to <ulink url="&qpidProgrammingBook;">Programming in Apache Qpid</ulink>.</para>
