    <para>The Qpid JMS client is available as a bundle or from &qpidMavenRepoDesc;.</para>
    <para>The bundle (a .tar.gz) includes the Qpid JMS client itself (formed by two JAR: qpid-client
      and qpid-common) together with slf4j-api, and geronimo-jms_1.1_spec. There is also a qpid-all
      JAR artifact that, for convenience, includes a manifest classpath that references the other
      JARs. The bundle is available from <ulink url="&qpidDownloadUrl;"
        >&qpidDownloadUrlDesc;</ulink>.</para>
    <para>The Qpid JMS client is also available from &qpidMavenRepoDesc;. Add the following
