  <title>Exceptions</title>

  <para>The methods of Qpid JMS Client throw <ulink
      url="&oracleJeeDocUrl;javax/jms/JMSException.html">JMSExceptions</ulink> in response to error
    conditions. Typically the exception's message (#getMessage()) summarises the error condition,
    with contextual information being provided by the messages of linked exception(s). To understand
    the problem, it is important to read the messages associated with <emphasis>all</emphasis> the
    linked exceptions.</para>

  <para>The following table describes some of the more common exceptions linked to JMSException
    thrown by JMS methods whilst using the client:</para>
