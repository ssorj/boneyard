<chapter id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging">
  <title>Logging</title>
  <para>The Qpid JMS client uses the <ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org">Apache SLF4J</ulink> logging
    framework. All logging activity created by the client is directed through the SLF4J API. SLF4J
    is a is a fa√ßade for other common logging frameworks. This makes it easy for application authors
    to use their prefered logging framework in their application stack, and have the Qpid JMS Client
    use it too. </para>
  <para>SLF4J suppplies bindings for many common logging frameworks (<ulink
      url="&oracleJdkDocUrl;java/util/logging/package-summary.html">JUL</ulink>, <ulink
      url="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">Apache Log4J</ulink>, <ulink
      url="http://logback.qos.ch">Logback</ulink>.</para>
  <para>Include the SLF4J binding corresponding to the logging framework of your choosen logging
    framework on classpath. For full details, see the SLF4J <ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org"
      >documentation</ulink>.</para>

  <section id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging-RecommendedProductionLoggingLevel">
    <title>Recommended Production Logging Level</title>
    <para>In production, it is recommended that you configure your logging framework is configured
      with logger <literal>org.apache.qpid</literal> set to <literal>WARN</literal>.</para>
    <para>If you are using Apache Log4j with a log4j.properties file, this simply means adding the
      following line:</para>
    <screen>
      org.apache.qpid=WARN
    </screen>
    <para>If you are using another logging framework, or you are using Log4j but configuring in
      another manner, refer to the documentation accompanying the logging framework for details of
      how to proceed.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="JMS-Client-0-8-Logging-EnablingDebugLogging">
    <title>Enabling Debug</title>
    <para>If you are experiencing a problem, it can be informative to enable debug logging to allow
      the behaviour of the Qpid JMS client to be understood at a deeper level.</para>
    <para>To do this, set the <literal>org.apache.qpid</literal> logger to
      <literal>DEBUG</literal>.</para>
    <para>If you are using Apache Log4j with a log4j.properties file, this simply means adding (or
      changing) the following line:</para>
    <screen>
      org.apache.qpid=DEBUG
    </screen>
    <para>If you are using another logging framework, or you are using Log4j but configuring in
      another manner, refer to the documentation accompanying the logging framework for details of
      how to proceed.</para>
