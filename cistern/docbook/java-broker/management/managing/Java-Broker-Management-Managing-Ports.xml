<section id="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Ports">
    <title>Ports</title>
    <para>Ports provide TCP/IP connectivity for messaging and management. A port is defined to use a
        protocol. This can be an AMQP protocol for messaging or HTTP/JMX for management.</para>
    <para>A port is defined to have one or more transports. A transport can either be plain (TCP) or
        SSL. When SSL is in use, the port can be configured to accept or require client
        authentication.</para>
    <para>Any number of ports defined to use AMQP or HTTP protocols can be defined. JMX is limited
        to a single port instance per JMX protocol type.</para>
    <para>Ports can only be managed by the HTTP management channel.</para>
