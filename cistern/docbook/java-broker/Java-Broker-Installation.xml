    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This document describes how to install the Java Broker on both Windows and UNIX
      platforms.</para>

      <title>Java Platform</title>
      <para> The Java Broker is an 100% Java implementation and as such it can be used on any
        operating system supporting Java 1.7  or higher<footnote><para>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
          Unlimited Strength required for some features</para></footnote>. This includes Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and
        Windows XP/Vista/7/8.</para>
      <para> The broker has been tested with Java implementations from both Oracle and IBM. Whatever
        platform you chose, it is recommended that you ensure it is patched with any critical
        updates made available from the vendor. </para>
      <para> Verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <link
          linkend="Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification">these instructions.</link>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section role="h3" id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Disk">
      <title>Disk</title>
      <para>The Java Broker installation requires approximately 20MB of free disk space.</para>
      <para>The Java Broker also requires a working directory. The working directory is used for the
        message store, that is, the area of the file-system used to record persistent messages
        whilst they are passing through the Broker. The working directory is also used for the
        default location of the log file. The size of the working directory will depend on the how
        the Broker is used.</para>
      <para>The performance of the file system hosting the work directory is key to the performance
        of Broker as a whole. For best performance, choose a device that has low latency and one
        that is uncontended by other applications.</para>
      <para>Be aware that there are additional considerations if you are considering hosting the
        working directory on NFS.</para>
    </section>
    <section role="h3" id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-Memory">
      <title>Memory</title>
      <para>Qpid caches messages on the heap for performance reasons, so in general, the Broker will
        benefit from as much heap as possible. However, on a 32bit JVM, the maximum addressable
        memory range for a process is 4GB, after leaving space for the JVM's own use this will give
        a maximum heap size of approximately ~3.7GB.</para>
    </section>
    <section role="h3" id="Java-Broker-Installation-Prerequistes-OperatingSystemAccount">
      <title>Operating System Account</title>
      <para>Installation or operation of Qpid does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require a privileged
        account (i.e. root on UNIX platforms or Administrator on Windows). However it is suggested
        that you use an dedicated account (e.g. qpid) for the installation and operation of the Java
        Broker.</para>

      <para>You can download the latest Java broker package from the <ulink url="&qpidDownloadUrl;"
          >Download Page</ulink>. </para>
      <para> It is recommended that you confirm the integrity of the download by verifying the PGP
        signature matches that available on the site. Instructions are given on the download page.

    <title>Installation on Windows</title>
    <para> Firstly, verify that your JVM is installed properly by following <link
        linkend="Java-Broker-Miscellaneous-JVM-Verification-Windows">these instructions.</link>
    </para>
    <para>Now chose a directory for Qpid broker installation. This directory will be used for the
      Qpid JARs and configuration files. It need not be the same location as the work directory used
      for the persistent message store or the log file (you will choose this location later). For
      the remainder this example we will assume that location c:\qpid has been chosen.</para>
    <para>Next extract the &windowsBrokerDownloadFileName; package into the directory, using either
      the zip file handling offered by Windows (right click the file and select 'Extract All') or a
      third party tool of your choice.</para>
    <para>The extraction of the broker package will have created a directory
      &windowsExtractedBrokerDirName; within c:\qpid</para>
