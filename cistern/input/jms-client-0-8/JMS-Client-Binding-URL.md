# <span class="header-section-number">1</span> Binding URL

The *Binding URL* syntax for addressing<span
id="fnref1">[^1^](#fn1)</span>. It allows the specification of the
bindings between a queue and an exchange, queue and exchange creation
arguments and some ancillary options.

The format for a *Binding URL* is provided below

    <Exchange Class>://<Exchange Name>/[<Destination>]/[<Queue>][?<option>='<value>'[&<option>='<value>']]
        

where

-   *Exchange Class*, specifies the type of the exchange, for example,
    *direct*,*topic*,*fanout*, etc.

-   *Exchange Name*, specifies the name of the exchange, for example,
    *amq.direct*,*amq.topic*, etc.

-   *Destination*, is an optional part of *Binding URL*. It can be used
    to specify a routing key with the non direct exchanges if an option
    *routingkey* is not specified. If both *Destination* and option
    *routingkey* are specified, then option *routingkey* has precedence.

-   *Queue*, is an optional part of *Binding URL* to specify a queue
    name for JMS queue destination. It is ignored in JMS topic
    destinations. Queue names may consist of any mixture of digits,
    letters, and underscores

-   *Options*, key-value pairs separated by '=' character specifying
    queue and exchange creation arguments, routing key, client
    behaviour, etc.

> **Important**
>
> Take care with the quoting surrounding option values. Each option
> value *must* be surrounded with single quotes (').

# <span class="header-section-number">2</span> Binding URL Examples

## <span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Binding URLs for declaring of JMS Queues

The Qpid client Binding URLs for JMS queue destinations can be declared
using direct exchange (Mostly it is a pre-defined exchange with a name
"amq.direct". Also, custom direct exchanges can be used.):

    direct://amq.direct//<Queue Name>
             

The Binding URLs for destinations created with calls to
*Session.createQueue(String)* can be expressed as

    direct://amq.direct//<Queue Name>?durable='true'
             

The durability flag is set to *true* in such destinations.

    direct://amq.direct//myNonDurableQueue
    direct://amq.direct//myDurableQueue?durable='true'
    direct://amq.direct//myAnotherQueue?durable='true'&routingkey='myqueue'
    direct://amq.direct//myQueue?durable='true'&routingkey='myqueue'&rejectbehaviour='server'
    direct://custom.direct//yetAnotherQueue
            

## <span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Binding URLs for declaring of JMS Topics

The Binding URLs for JMS queue destinations can be declared using topic
exchange (A pre-defined exchange having name "amq.topic" is used mainly.
However, custom topic exchanges can be used as well):

    topic://amq.topic//<Queue name>?routingkey='<Topic Name>'&exclusive='true'&autodelete='true'
             

The Binding URLs for a topic destination created with calls to
*Session.createTopic("hello")* is provided below:

    topic://amq.topic/hello/tmp_127_0_0_1_36973_1?routingkey='hello'&exclusive='true'&autodelete='true'
            

## <span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Wildcard characters in routing keys for topic destinations

AMQP exchanges of class *topic* can route messages to the queues using
special matches containing wildcard characters (a "\#" matches one or
more words, a "\*" matches a single word). The routing keys words are
separated with a "." delimiter to distinguish words for matching. Thus,
if a consumer application specifies a routing key in the destination
like "usa.\#", it should receive all the messages matching to that
routing key. For example, "usa.boston", "usa.new-york", etc.

The examples of the *Binding URLs* having routing keys with wildcards
characters are provided below:

    topic://amq.topic?routingkey='stocks.#'
    topic://amq.topic?routingkey='stocks.*.ibm'
    topic://amq.topic?routingkey='stocks.nyse.ibm'
