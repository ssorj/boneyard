# <span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction

Qpid provides two AMQP messaging brokers:

-   Implemented in C++ - high performance, low latency, and RDMA
    support.

-   Implemented in Java - Fully JMS compliant, runs on any Java
    platform.

Both AMQP messaging brokers support clients in multiple languages, as
long as the messaging client and the messaging broker use the same
version of AMQP. See [AMQP Compatibility](#AMQP-Compatibility) to see
which messaging clients work with each broker.

This manual contains information specific to the broker that is
implemented in C++.
