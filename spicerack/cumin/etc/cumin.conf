# *************** Some parameter explanations by section ***************

## [common]

## sasl-mech-list:
## A space separated list that restricts the SASL mechanisms 
## Cumin may use when authenticating to the broker.  By default
## Cumin will use ANONYMOUS authentication if the broker URL does
## not contain user/password and will use PLAIN or DIGEST-MD5
## if the broker URL does contain user/password.  DIGEST-MD5 is
## considered more secure than PLAIN by SASL and will be 
## used if is available.  This value may be set explicitly
## to make other choices.
## Setting the value to 'AVAILABLE' will allow Cumin to use
## any available mechanism including ANONYMOUS. 

## wallaby-broker: [first item in 'brokers' list]
## The broker to use for interaction with a Wallaby agent.
## This is not necessarily the same broker used for grid
## and messaging information.  The default value is the
## first item in the 'brokers' list if not specified.  To
## turn off interaction with Wallaby, set wallaby-broker to
## the string 'None'.

## wallaby-refresh: 60
## How often in seconds to contact the Wallaby agent
## for updated information.

## aviary-job-servers: http://localhost:9090
## Specifies the URIs for aviary job servers.  The value
## is a comma separated list of URIs.  A full URI has the
## form 'scheme://user/password@host:port/path".  The scheme
## will default to http if not specified, the port will
## default to 9090, and the path will default to
## /services/job/.  User and password will be empty by
## default.  As a convenience, a URI that explicitly
## sets a port number may be followed by one or more
## port numbers separated by commas to specify
## mulitple job servers whose URIs differ only
## by port number.  This parameter must be non-empty
## in order for aviary job servers to be used, even
## if aviary-locator has been set.

## aviary-query-servers: http://localhost:9091
## Like aviary-job-servers but specifies URIs for aviary
## query servers.  The port value defaults to 9091 and the
## path defaults to /services/query/. Other
## defaults are as noted for aviary-job-servers.
## This parameter must be non-empty in order for aviary 
## query servers to be used, even if aviary-locator 
## has been set.

## aviary-locator: http://localhost:9000
## Specifies the URI for the aviary locator.  This is 
## a single value, not a list of URIs.  The form of
## the URI is the same as that of aviary-job-servers.
## The port will  default to 9000 and the path will 
## default to /services/locator/locate.  Other defaults
## are as noted for aviary-job-servers.

## log-max-mb: 10
## Maximum size in MB of *.log files created by cumin.
## A log file reaching maximum size will be rolled over.
## A value of 0 leaves the log file size unlimited.

## log-max-archives: 1
## Number of rolled over log files to retain.  A retained
## log file will have a "." and a number added to its name.
## A value of 0 will cause a log file to be truncated
## rather than renamed if it reaches maximum size.

## [web]

## log-file:
## If the value starts with "/" it is an absolute path for the
## log file.  Otherwise, the value will be a relative path.
## For a relative path, the base path will be $CUMIN_HOME/log/.
## If $CUMIN_HOME is not defined, the base will be /usr/share/cumin/log/.

## server-cert:
## This is a server certificate file in PEM format.
## If server-cert and server-key are both set and valid,
## Cumin will use ssl.  The scheme in the Cumin URL will
## be "https://" instead of "http://".

## server-key:
## This is a key file in PEM format that corresponds to
## the server-cert. If server-cert and server-key are both
## set and valid, Cumin will use ssl.  The scheme in the 
## Cumin URL will be "https://" instead of "http://".

## persona: grid
## Controls content of the top level page.
## Valid values are "default", "grid", and "messaging".
## The "default" persona contains content for both grid and
## messaging.

## authorize: False
## Controls whether or not roles are enforced.
## Roles are assigned to users with cumin-admin.
## If roles are enforced, users with only the 'user'
## role will not see the 'Administrator' tab.
## The default role for a new user is 'user'.

## auth:
## Allows specification of LDAP servers for external authentication of
## users during login. A server must support simple bind for authentication.
## This is a semicolon separated list of URLs of the following form:
##
## ldap://host:port/dn??scope?filter
##
## Scope defaults to 'sub', filter defaults to 'uid=usnername'.
## If a filter is specified Cumin will replace occurrences of %%s
## with username. Example:
## ldap://alpha.exmple.com/ou=users,dc=example,dc=com;
##  ldap://beta.example.com/ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?mail=%%s

## ldap_tls_cacertfile:
## Setting this option turns on SSL communication to all LDAP servers.
## Specifies a file containing certificates for all the Certificate
## Authorities that Cumin will recognize.  An LDAP server certificate
## must be issued by a recognized Certificate Authority or Cumin will
## refuse to communicate with the server.
## If this option is set, Cumin will look at the specified file before
## looking in the directory specified by ldap_tls_cacertdir.

## ldap_tls_cacertdir:
## Setting this option turns on SSL communication to all LDAP servers.
## Specifies a directory containing certificates for all the Certificate
## Authorities that Cumin will recognize.  Certificates may be in individual
## files or in a certificate database created with certutil.
## An LDAP server certificate must be issued by a recognized Certificate 
## Authority or Cumin will refuse to communicate with the server.
## If ldap_tls_cacertfile is set, Cumin will look in that file before
## looking in this directory.

## ldap_timeout: 30
## Timeout in seconds for connections to an LDAP server

## [data]

## log-file:
## See notes under the [web] section

## expire-enabled: True
## Whether or not the instance runs a thread which periodically expires samples.
## Running the expire thread from more than one instance is okay but unnecessary

## expire-interval: 3600
## How often the expire thread runs, in seconds

## expire-threshold: 86400
## The maximum age of a sample in seconds.  If it's older, it will be deleted when
## the expire thread runs.

## vacuum-enabled: True
## Whether or not the instance runs a thread which periodically vacuums the
## database.  Running the vacuum thread from more than one instance is okay but
## unnecessary.

## vacuum-interval: 3600
## How often the vacuum thread runs, in seconds

## include-classes: [all]
## A comma separated list of QMF classes.  The default value is all
## classes in all packages. The cumin-data instance will be bound to 
## classes which appear in 'include-classes' but do not appear in 
## 'exclude-classes'.  Classes are specified as package:class for a single 
## class or package:* for all classes in a package.

## exclude-classes: [empty list]
## A comma separated list of QMF classes.  The default value is
## an empty list. The cumin-data instance will be bound to 
## classes which appear in 'include-classes' but do not appear in 
## 'exclude-classes'.  Classes are specified as package:class for a single 
## class or package:* for all classes in a package.

## webs: web
## Comma separated list of sections in this file.
## Each section specifies the configuration for a separate
## instance of cumin-web.

## datas: data
## Comma separated list of sections in this file.

## instance of cumin-data.
