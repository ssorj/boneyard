<p class="initial">Hello.  This is a little application to explain the
features of the <strong>Wooly</strong> web user-interface toolkit.</p>

<p>The code for this demo is available in the <tt>wooly.demo</tt>
module.</p>

<h2 class="initial">Basic Links</h2>

<p>A <tt>Link</tt> renders an HTML link with a URL to an alternate
page state.  In Wooly, this is how transitions from one view or state
to another are accomplished.</p>

<p>A <tt>Link</tt> is really just a thin wrapper around the more
fundamental ability in Wooly to take an existing <tt>Session</tt>
object, with all its current state, and change just one part of it in
order to produce a new, different URL and view.</p>

<div class="instance">
  <h3 class="initial">A link that changes the view to the intro tab</h3>

  <p>{visit_intro_link}</p>
</div>

<h2>Toggles</h2>

<p>A <tt>Toggle</tt> is a <tt>Link</tt> that remembers whether it is
toggled or not.  It's often useful to use that state to trigger other
behaviors.</p>

<p>Internally, <tt>Toggle</tt> holds a <tt>BooleanParameter</tt>
called "toggled".  Each time the <tt>Toggle</tt> is rendered, it
generates a URL for its other possible state, toggled if it's
currently untoggled and vice versa.</p>

<div class="instance">
  <h3 class="initial">A single toggle with a conditionally rendered message</h3>

  <p><div class="secret">{secret}</div> {secret_toggle}</p>
</div>
