 - Separate encoding
 - Write a test script, tubadev-test
   - Reinstate the tuba command
   - Sample data?  Make it easy to load it.
 - Fix the 0-byte stream bug
   - Would it help to check tuner busy-ness?
 - Make qam/atsc configurable
   - Take conf from dvb.channels
 - Mock capture mode?
 - In schema, rename recordings.file to filename
 - In log, indicate next scheduled capture
 - Put content format in tuba file names (.480i.stream)
 - Somehow move projectx remuxing into java code
 - Basic web ui
 - Somehow get rid of the withay stuff, or clear up its legality
 - Having global static capture and update sessions is dubious
 - Get rid of capture.recordings_dir
 - Right now we just blow up if dvb.channels is missing
