softskip,scale=720:-2 -o Fixed-ts.avi Input.ts

you may wanna change that around a little, but its the bulk of
it. just please realize what this is doing and why i wrote it this
way. Im currently writing some software for *nix that takes a .tp
stream and converts it, strips commercials, and stuff. this is the
profile im using now to fix the hdtv stream. please note, im dropping
the framerate from 60fps to 30fps (thats what softskip helps with...i
find it works better then decimate for some reason), scalling it down
to 720:-2 (the -2 autosizes it). 8000kbit/s maintains the bitrate
pulled down by the stream (it can be lower then the 19mbit/s that it
comes in at because im scalling it down enough...the bpp is actually
higher in my encode then the original so i dont think your going to
get any better). the mbd and keyint stuff are a little hardcore but
thats because im doing ALOT of searching through the stream and having
software interprit whats comming out so i like the ability to be able
to be that accurate in the stream.

tweak as you may want...but it works. ive thus far tested it on
everything from a 720p recording of house and lost to a 480i recording
of family guy (i reduced the scale to scale=-2:480 for that...no sense
in blowing up the image right). also note i am running it into a 2
channel mp3 audio track from the ac3 that its comming with. the
preset=insane option locks it in at a 320kbps bitrate which to me is
plenty enough.

hope that helps

Hey all.
I've been toying around with encoding HDTV, complete with AC3 streams. I 
grabbed a large chunk (about 3.5 GB), and encoded it to xvid using the 
following command:

mencoder stream.ts -vf scale=1280:720,dsize=16/9,pp=h1/v1/dr/al/lb -sws 
10 -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts 
pass=2:bitrate=4000:me_quality=6:vhq=4:chroma_me:qpel -o stream.avi

The "-oac copy" works, and I get an xvid file with ac3 audio.

However, if I just want to make another mpeg file like so :

mencoder stream.ts -oac copy -ovc copy -of mpeg -o stream_1.mpg

there is no audio. Any idea why "-oac copy" works for xvid, but not 
standard mpeg ? I've used "oac copy" for streams with mp2 audio with no 
problems ...

I'll appreciate any help.
