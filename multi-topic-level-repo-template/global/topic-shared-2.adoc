= Topic Shared 2

This topic shows how to use conditional preprocessor directives to control the content.

== Display Content Dependent on a Specific Book

`Topic 2` is included only in _{MyTitleABookName}_, so you have to refer to it differently if you are within the book than when it is included in a different book.

* When the shared topic is buil5 for _{MyTitleABookName}_, it displays an `xref:` to that topic.
* If it is rendered for a different book, it just provides text directing them to the topic in _{MyTitleABookName}_.

The following content renders differently depending on the book:

// Use an xref: when referring to a topic or section within the same book
ifdef::my-title-a[]
//* Since this topic is in book _{MyTitleABookName}_, see xref:topic-shared-1[Topic Shared 1] in this book.
TODO: improve this text and make it more exemplary of...something.
endif::[]

// Use text or an external link when referring to a topic or section not defined within the book
ifndef::my-title-a[]
* For more information, see _Topic 2_ in book _{MyTitleABookName}_.
endif::[]

// Add text only for MyTitleABookName
ifdef::my-title-a[]
* This is content only for book _{MyTitleABookName}_.
endif::[]

// Add text only for MyTitleBBookName
ifdef::my-title-b[]
* This is content only for book _{MyTitleBBookName}_.
endif::[]

// Add text only for MyTitleCBookName
ifdef::my-title-c[]
* This is content only for book _{MyTitleCBookName}_.
endif::[]
