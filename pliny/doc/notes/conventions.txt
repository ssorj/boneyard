 - Parameter variables are named with the suffix '_param', as in
   'alpha_param'.  The suffix helps avoid collisions for commonplace
   things such as 'name'.  The parameter's name attribute, however,
   remains unqualified, as in 'alpha'.

   self.submit_param = SymbolParameter(self, "submit")

 - Page variables are named with '_page', and frames with '_frame'.
   Again, this is to avoid collisions.  The name attributes for the
   respective constructors remain unqualified.

   On frames:       self.view_page = AddressView(self, "view")
   On application:  self.address_frame = AddressFrame(self, "address")
