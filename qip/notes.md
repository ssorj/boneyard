# Notes

 - A QIP should describe a single well-focused improvement.

 - QIPs are written in [Markdown
   format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and then
   converted to HTML before they are published.

 - Numbers are assigned once a QIP is accepted.

 - If a section of the template doesn't apply, remove it.
