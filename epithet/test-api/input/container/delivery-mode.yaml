  AT-MOST-ONCE:
    description: |
      Unreliable delivery.  The sender settles the message as
      soon as it sends it.  If the connection is lost before the
      message is received, the message will not be delivered.
  AT-LEAST-ONCE:
    description: |
      Reliable delivery.  The receiver accepts and settles the
      message on receipt.  If the connection is lost before the
      sender is informed of the settlement, then the delivery is
      considered in-doubt and will be retried.  This will ensure
      it eventually gets delivered, provided the connection and
      link can be reestablished.  It may, however, be delivered
      multiple times.
  EXACTLY-ONCE:
    description: |
      Reliable delivery with no duplicates.  The receiver
      accepts the message but doesn't settle it.  The sender
      settles once it is aware that the receiver accepted it.
      In this way the receiver retains knowledge of an accepted
      message until it is sure the sender knows it has been
      accepted.  If the connection is lost before settlement,
      the receiver informs the sender of all the unsettled
      deliveries it knows about, and from this the sender can
      deduce which need to be redelivered. The sender likewise
      informs the receiver which deliveries it knows about, from
      which the receiver can deduce which have already been
      settled.
